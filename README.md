# OrderedArrayList
If you are overriding a method, are we able to just use ArrayList.add inside NullArrayList.add as long as there is no null? Yes

Can we just extend ArrayList or is there a code for it? Just extend the class. 

How would we write a constructor if we cannot access the variables? Super

Do we use super to call parent methods? No, I think you just use something like ArrayList.____
